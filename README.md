## Hi everybody!

🪐 I'm Beatrice from Italy! I'm 25 yo and I LOVE astronomy and physics.
I have always had a great passion for the universe and all his mysteries.
🔭 I'm currently studying astronomy at the University of Padua, one of the cities where Galielo Galieli lived!

Given the great influence of artificial intelligence in the astronomical world, I am deepening my studies in Deep Learning and neural networks in order to combine these two passions.
✨🌊 To do that I am also pursuing a self-taught project in Machine Learning and Gravitational Waves, with GWOSC data.

💻 I took an initial course in Machine Learning & AI at the Canadian academy ZTM.
I then started a path with Coursera and DeepLearning.AI courses (ongoing).

⚡ Fun fact: I used to hate math but then I realised that it makes me understand so many incredible things and I'm actually decent at it!
